I studied Computer Science and Finance as a dual degree at Tsinghua, and further specialized in their intersection—AI in finance—during my master's program. This training equipped me with both rigorous financial theory and strong programming skills.

My professional journey has spanned AI research, the sellside, and the buyside, giving me firsthand exposure to multiple approaches in finance and technology. Through these experiences, I developed a clear passion for quantitative research, particularly the application of large language models. As WorldQuant's Igor Tulchinsky has observed, "The first thing that the LLM can do is structure data, and 80% of data out there is unstructured." I believe this technology holds significant potential for advancing quantitative research.

Going forward, I aim to contribute to a leading QR team by leveraging finance and AI to build scalable, data-driven strategies.
