Hi, I'm Yuchen ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website.

I studied Computer Science and Finance as a dual degree at Tsinghua, and later focused on their intersectionâ€”AI in financeâ€”during my master's program. This gave me both rigorous training in financial theory and solid programming skills.

Professionally, I've explored different perspectives across AI research, the sellside, and the buyside. These experiences not only broadened my understanding of finance and technology, but also helped me find my direction in quantitative research. I'm especially curious about how new technologiesâ€”such as large language models, which can turn unstructured data into usable signalsâ€”might open up fresh possibilities in this field.

Looking ahead, I hope to contribute to a leading quantitative research team, where I can combine finance and AI to develop scalable, data-driven strategies.
