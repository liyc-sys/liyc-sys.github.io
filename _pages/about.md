Hi, I'm Yuchen ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my personal website.

I studied Computer Science and Finance as a dual degree at Tsinghua University, and later explored their intersectionâ€”AI and data analytics in financeâ€”during my master's program. This gave me both rigorous training in financial theory and strong technical skills in programming and data analysis.

Professionally, I've gained experience across AI research, buyside&sellside quantitative finance, and data-driven projects. These experiences broadened my perspective on how technology and algorithms can be applied to solve complex problems and generate actionable insights in various domains.

Looking ahead, I hope to contribute to a dynamic team where I can leverage both finance and AI to tackle challenging problems, build effective data-driven solutions, and create meaningful impact across industries.
