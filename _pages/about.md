Welcome to my personal academic website. I am currently pursuing a Master's degree in Financial Technology (Artificial Intelligence and Finance Track) at Tsinghua University with a GPA of 4.0, holding an Excellence Scholarship that covers 50% of my tuition.

My research and professional interests span across artificial intelligence, quantitative finance, and machine learning applications in financial markets. I have worked as an AI Research Intern at Zhipu AI and as a Quantitative Research Intern at leading financial institutions including CICC-Fixed Income and Boyu Capital.

This website showcases my publications, research experience, and professional background in both AI and quantitative finance.
